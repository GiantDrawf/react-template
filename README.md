# react app

This is a project template for react apps.

To create a new project based on this template using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

```bash
npx degit GiantDrawf/react-template react-app
cd react-app
```

_Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed._

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd react-app
yarn
```

...then start:

```bash
yarn start
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and you will see your changes.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
yarn run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `yarn run start`.
